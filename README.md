I **love** poetry.... _most of the time._

Here's the function `add10`:

```js
function add10(n){
  return n + 10;
}
```

Now for some poetry by Walt Whitman:

> I celebrate myself, and sing myself,  
> And what I assume you shall assume,  
> For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.  
> I loafe and invite my soul,  
> I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.
